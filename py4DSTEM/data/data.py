class Data:
    """
    The purpose of the `Data` class is to ensure calibrations are linked
    to data containing class instances, while allowing multiple objects
    to share a single Calibration. The calibrations of a Data instance
    `data` is accessible as

        >>> data.calibration

    In py4DSTEM, Data containing objects are stored internally in filetree
    like representations, defined by the EMD1.0 and `emdfile` specifications,
    e.g.

    Root
      |--metadata
      |     |--calibration
      |
      |--some_object(e.g.datacube)
      |     |--another_object(e.g.max_dp)
      |             |--etc.
      |
      |--one_more_object(e.g.crystal)
      |     |--etc.
      :

    Calibrations are metadata which always live in the root of such a tree.
    Running `data.calibration` returns the calibrations from the tree root,
    and therefore the same calibration instance is referred to be all objects
    in the same tree.  The root itself is accessible from any Data instance
    as

        >>> data.root

    To examine the tree of a Data instance, in a Python interpreter do

        >>> data.tree(True)

    to display the whole data tree, and

        >>> data.tree()

    to display the tree of from the current node on, i.e. the branch
    downstream of `data`.

    Calling

        >>> data.calibration

    will raise a warning and return None if no root calibrations are found.

    Some objects should be modified when the calibrations change - these
    objects must have .calibrate() method, which is called any time relevant
    calibration parameters change if the object has been registered with
    the calibrations.

    To transfer `data` from it's current tree to another existing tree, use

        >>> data.attach(some_other_data)

    which will move the data to the new tree. If the data was registered with
    it's old calibrations, this will also de-register it there and register
    it with the new calibrations such that .calibrate() is called when it
    should be.
