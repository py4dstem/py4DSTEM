class Array:
    """
    A class which stores any N-dimensional array-like data, plus basic metadata:
    a name and units, as well as calibrations for each axis of the array, and names
    and units for those axis calibrations.

    In the simplest usage, only a data array is passed:

    >>> ar = Array(np.ones((20,20,256,256)))

    will create an array instance whose data is the numpy array passed, and with
    automatically populated dimension calibrations in units of pixels.

    Additional arguments may be passed to populate the object metadata:

    >>> ar = Array(
    >>>     np.ones((20,20,256,256)),
    >>>     name = 'test_array',
    >>>     units = 'intensity',
    >>>     dims = [
    >>>         [0,5],
    >>>         [0,5],
    >>>         [0,0.01],
    >>>         [0,0.01]
    >>>     ],
    >>>     dim_units = [
    >>>         'nm',
    >>>         'nm',
    >>>         'A^-1',
    >>>         'A^-1'
    >>>     ],
    >>>     dim_names = [
    >>>         'rx',
    >>>         'ry',
    >>>         'qx',
    >>>         'qy'
    >>>     ],
    >>> )

    will create an array with a name and units for its data, where its first two
    dimensions are in units of nanometers, have pixel sizes of 5nm, and are
    described by the handles 'rx' and 'ry', and where its last two dimensions
    are in units of inverse Angstroms, have pixels sizes of 0.01A^-1, and are
    described by the handles 'qx' and 'qy'.

    Arrays in which the length of each pixel is non-constant are also
    supported.  For instance,

    >>> x = np.logspace(0,1,100)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)
    >>> ar = Array(
    >>>     y,
    >>>     dims = [
    >>>         x
    >>>     ]
    >>> )

    generates an array representing the values of the sine function sampled
    100 times along a logarithmic interval from 1 to 10. In this example,
    this data could then be plotted with, e.g.

    >>> plt.scatter(ar.dims[0], ar.data)

    If the `slicelabels` keyword is passed, the first N-1 dimensions of the
    array are treated normally, while the final dimension is used to represent
    distinct arrays which share a common shape and set of dim vectors.  Thus

    >>> ar = Array(
    >>>     np.ones((50,50,4)),
    >>>     name = 'test_array_stack',
    >>>     units = 'intensity',
    >>>     dims = [
    >>>         [0,2],
    >>>         [0,2]
    >>>     ],
    >>>     dim_units = [
    >>>         'nm',
    >>>         'nm'
    >>>     ],
    >>>     dim_names = [
    >>>         'rx',
    >>>         'ry'
    >>>     ],
    >>>     slicelabels = [
    >>>         'a',
    >>>         'b',
    >>>         'c',
    >>>         'd'
    >>>     ]
    >>> )

    will generate a single Array instance containing 4 arrays which each have
    a shape (50,50) and a common set of dim vectors ['rx','ry'], and which
    can be indexed into with the names assigned in `slicelabels` using

    >>> ar.get_slice('a')

    which will return a 2D (non-stack-like) Array instance with shape (50,50)
    and the dims assigned above.  The Array attribute .rank is equal to the
    number of dimensions for a non-stack-like Array, and is equal to N-1
    for stack-like arrays.

        Accepts:
            data (np.ndarray): the data
            name (str): the name of the Array
            units (str): units for the pixel values
            dims (variable): calibration vectors for each of the axes of the data
                array.  Valid values for each element of the list are None,
                a number, a 2-element list/array, or an M-element list/array
                where M is the data array.  If None is passed, the dim will be
                populated with integer values starting at 0 and its units will
                be set to pixels.  If a number is passed, the dim is populated
                with a vector beginning at zero and increasing linearly by this
                step size.  If a 2-element list/array is passed, the dim is
                populated with a linear vector with these two numbers as the first
                two elements.  If a list/array of length M is passed, this is used
                as the dim vector, (and must therefore match this dimension's
                length). If dims recieves a list of fewer than N arguments for an
                N-dimensional data array, the extra dimensions are populated as if
                None were passed, using integer pixel values. If the `dims`
                parameter is not passed, all dim vectors are populated this way.
            dim_units (list): the units for the calibration dim vectors. If
                nothing is passed, dims vectors which have been populated
                automatically with integers corresponding to pixel numbers
                will be assigned units of 'pixels', and any other dim vectors
                will be assigned units of 'unknown'.  If a list with length <
                the array dimensions, the passed values are assumed to apply
                to the first N dimensions, and the remaining values are
                populated with 'pixels' or 'unknown' as above.
            dim_names (list): labels for each axis of the data array. Values
                which are not passed, following the same logic as described
                above, will be autopopulated with the name "dim#" where #
                is the axis number.
            slicelabels (None or True or list): if not None, must be True or a
                list of strings, indicating a "stack-like" array.  In this case,
                the first N-1 dimensions of the array are treated normally, in
                the sense of populating dims, dim_names, and dim_units, while the
                final dimension is treated distinctly: it indexes into
                distinct arrays which share a set of dimension attributes, and
                can be sliced into using the string labels from the `slicelabels`
                list, with the syntax array['label'] or array.get_slice('label').
                If `slicelabels` is `True` or is a list with length less than the
                final dimension length, unassigned dimensions are autopopulated
