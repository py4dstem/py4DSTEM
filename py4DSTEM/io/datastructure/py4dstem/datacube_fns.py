    Finds the Bragg disks by cross correlation with `template`.

    For each diffraction image, the algorithm works in 4 steps:

    (1) optional pre-processing by passing the image through some
        `filter_funtion`, which should accept and return 2D arrays
    (2) the image is cross correlated with the template.
        Phase/hybrid correlations can be used instead by setting the
        `corrPower` argument. Cross correlation can be skipped entirely,
        and steps 3 and 4 performed directly on the diffraction
        image itself rathar than a cross correlation, by passing None
        to `template`.
    (3) the maxima of the cross correlation are located and their
        positions and intensities stored. The cross correlation may be
        passed through a gaussian filter first by passing the `sigma`
        argument. The method for maximum detection can be set with
        the `subpixel` parameter. Options, from something like fastest/least
        precise to slowest/most precise are 'pixel', 'poly', and 'multicorr'.
    (4) filtering is applied to remove untrusted or undesired positive counts,
        based on their intensity (`minRelativeIntensity`,`relativeToPeak`,
        `minAbsoluteIntensity`) their proximity to one another or the
        image edge (`minPeakSpacing`, `edgeBoundary`), and the total
        number of peaks per pattern (`maxNumPeaks`).


    Running on a subset of the data may be desireable, and is controlled
    by the `data` parameter. If None (default), runs on the whole DataCube,
    and stores the output in its tree. Otherwise, nothing is stored in tree,
    but some value is returned. Valid entries are:

        - a 2-tuple of numbers (rx,ry): run on this diffraction image,
            and return a QPoints instance
        - a 2-tuple of arrays (rx,ry): run on these diffraction images,
            and return a list of QPoints instances
        - an Rspace shapped 2D boolean array: run on the diffraction images
            specified by the True counts and return a list of QPoints instances


    Args:
        template (2D array): the vacuum probe template, in real space. For
            Probe instances, this is `probe.kernel`.  If None, does not perform
            a cross correlation.
        data (variable): see above.
        filter_function (callable): filtering function to apply to each
            diffraction pattern before peakfinding. Must be a function of only
            one argument (the diffraction pattern) and return the filtered
            diffraction pattern. The shape of the returned DP must match the
            shape of the probe kernel (but does not need to match the shape of
            the input diffraction pattern, e.g. the filter can be used to bin the
            diffraction pattern). If using distributed disk detection, the
            function must be able to be pickled with by dill.
        corrPower (float between 0 and 1, inclusive): the cross correlation
            power. A value of 1 corresponds to a cross correaltion, 0
            corresponds to a phase correlation, and intermediate values giving
            hybrid correlations.
        sigma (float): if >0, a gaussian smoothing filter with this standard
            deviation is applied to the cross correlation before maxima are
            detected
        subpixel (str): Whether to use subpixel fitting, and which algorithm to
            use. Must be in ('none','poly','multicorr').
                * 'none': performs no subpixel fitting
                * 'poly': polynomial interpolation of correlogram peaks (default)
                * 'multicorr': uses the multicorr algorithm with DFT upsampling
        upsample_factor (int): upsampling factor for subpixel fitting (only used
            when subpixel='multicorr')
        minAbsoluteIntensity (float): the minimum acceptable correlation peak
            intensity, on an absolute scale
        minRelativeIntensity (float): the minimum acceptable correlation peak
            intensity, relative to the intensity of the brightest peak
        relativeToPeak (int): specifies the peak against which the minimum
            relative intensity is measured -- 0=brightest maximum. 1=next
            brightest, etc.
        minPeakSpacing (float): the minimum acceptable spacing between detected
            peaks
        edgeBoundary (int): minimum acceptable distance for detected peaks from
            the diffraction image edge, in pixels.
        maxNumPeaks (int): the maximum number of peaks to return
        CUDA (bool): If True, import cupy and use an NVIDIA GPU to perform disk
            detection
        CUDA_batched (bool): If True, and CUDA is selected, the FFT and IFFT
            steps of disk detection are performed in batches to better utilize
            GPU resources.
        distributed (dict): contains information for parallel processing using an
            IPyParallel or Dask distributed cluster.  Valid keys are:
                * ipyparallel (dict):
                * client_file (str): path to client json for connecting to your
                    existing IPyParallel cluster
                * dask (dict): client (object): a dask client that connects to
                    your existing Dask cluster
                * data_file (str): the absolute path to your original data
                    file containing the datacube
                * cluster_path (str): defaults to the working directory during
                    processing
            if distributed is None, which is the default, processing will be in
            serial
        _qt_progress_bar (QProgressBar instance): used only by the GUI for serial
            execution
        name (str): name for the output BraggVectors
        returncalc (bool): if True, returns the answer
